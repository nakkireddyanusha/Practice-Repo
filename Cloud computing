cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, 
and intelligence—over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

The main three types of cloud computing are public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.
